  What's this:
</h1>
<p>
  This is the support data for the capacitive primateEyeTracker research paper. <br>
  Files end with ".mat" are MATLAB date stores; they contain the unprocessed capacitive readings and reference sclera coil signals. <br>
  Files end with ".mlx" are MATLAB LiveScripts; run them with ".mat" files recreate the data processing steps and final result. <br>
</p>

  Where can I find the paper/ or preprint?

<p>
  More details coming...
