<p>
  Still a draft.

  What's this:
</h1>
<p>
  This is the support data for the capacitive primateEyeTracker research paper. <br>
  Files end with ".mat" are MATLAB date stores; they contain the unprocessed capacitive readings and reference sclera coil signals. <br>
  Files end with ".mlx" are MATLAB LiveScripts; run them with ".mat" files recreate the data processing steps and final result. <br>
</p>
<h1>
  Prerequisite to run this:
</h1>
<p>
  Created with MATLAB 2023a (Version 9.14), older version may work. <br>
  Requires Wavelet Toolbox (Version 6.3), older version may work.
